            <p>Hard to believe that our last post was about Demo Day for the Sept. 2014 cohort - and now we’ve got two brand-new classes started!
Yesterday, our second Front End cohort jumped off the deep end and straight into their first assignment with David Rogers, the Front End instructor. At the same time, Brian Gates started our the inaugural Ruby on Rails course!
Can’t wait to see the progress these ladies and gentlemen make over the next 12 weeks!</p>

            <p>Hard to believe, but the Front End Cohort has completed their 12 weeks at The Iron Yard! Demo Day, last Friday, wrapped up the cohort in style. With over 50 people in attendance, seats in the Melrose Center filled up quickly!</p>

            <p>There were four student presentations of the team capstone projects completed during the final three weeks of the course - stay tuned for updates on the projects, and links!</p>

            <p>Student presentations were followed by Q&amp;A with student teams, and a happy hour down the street. Want to make sure you can make it to the next Demo Day? Join our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Iron-Yard-Orlando/">Meetup group</a>!</p>

            <h1>Demo Day is Around the Corner!</h1>
            <p>By Susanna Miller, Campus Director</p>
            <p>The title here begs the question: what is Demo Day? At its most basic, Demo Day is a showcase for our students - a chance to demonstrate what they’ve spend 12 weeks immersed in. Students will be presenting the applicants they pitched and voted on, à la Startup Weekend, and then created with sweat (and possibly a few tears) over the final three weeks of The Iron Yard program.</p>
            <p>Demo Day is also a great way to find out more about The Iron Yard, and meet the graduates and instructors in an informal setting. The Iron Yard Orlando’s Demo Day is less than two weeks away, and will be held in the state-of-the-art Melrose Center at the Downtown Public Library; we’re delighted to be able to use that awesome space to show off the talents and hard work of our skilled front end engineers!</p>
            <p>For more info about the details of the event, check out our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Iron-Yard-Orlando/events/218912707/">Meetup page</a>.</p>
